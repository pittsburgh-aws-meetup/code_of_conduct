## Harassment

The Pittsburgh AWS User Group is dedicated to providing a harassment-free community for everyone, regardless of sex, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, age, body size, race, nationality, or religious beliefs.

Harassment includes offensive verbal or written comments related to sex, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, age, body size, race, nationality, or religious beliefs, deliberate intimidation, threats, stalking, doxing, brigading, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any Pittsburgh AWS User Group event or communication channel. Community members asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

## Self Promotion & Soliciation

Community members should not use the user group, or user group resources for promotion or solicitation without approval from the organizers. This includes but is not limited to blogs, social media, external websites, video sharing sites.

## Repercussions

If a community member engages in negative behavior including but not limited to above, the Pittsburgh AWS User Group organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender, expulsion from the Pittsburgh AWS User Group community, and/or removal from an event.
